Even more so because I tend to drag my feet about things I actually really want to do. Building this site shouldn’t have taken as long as it did. Then again, maybe it also took as long as I needed to actually commit to doing it.\nBut I’m jumping ahead of myself. Who the heck am I, and what is this quaint little site all about?\nFirst Things First Well, in answer to your first question, my name is Jacob. I’m a 20something web-developer and tech enthusiast. I hail from Northern Ireland, but live in England1, and I’ve always enjoyed writing.\nI’ve always liked technology, too, but have had a reticence to write about it. The world feels inundated with tech-sites and reviewers these days. So who in the world thinks they can take on collectives like The Verge or the vast army of YouTube channels focused on observing the ever-shifting sands of the tech industry?\nBut, as ever with people and their hobbies, I’ve always found myself thinking about topics in this world, or around and about it.\nI have some friends I can talk about those thoughts to, sure. What I’ve never granted myself, however, was a space to really flesh them out or put them down in a way that feels more concrete and shareable.\nTo the Point Austin Kleon has a chapter in his book Show Your Work2 titled “Become a Documentarian of What You Do.” In a slightly orthogonal vein, this little pocket of the web is my documentation on what I think of ideas about, matters in, or products made within the modern tech scene.\nMostly, and genuinely, it’s somewhere for me to collect all of those things to show people later. I don’t have analytics, or sponsored reviews, or even interest in either of those things. I don’t really care about that type of success.\nIn a sense, as welcome as you are to stick around, this site isn’t made for a mass audience of random people.\nDon’t worry, it’s not you. It’s me. I’m just not ready for that level of commitment.\nAll joking aside, as I said before, I want to put things here to show people I know or happen to meet.3 Living up to it’s name, Jacob’s Tech Corner is just that, for me to store in and lift out of as needed.\nPoke Around That said, there are few cool bits and bobs here already that might catch your eye:\nPosts: If you’re reading this, I assume you’ve found that page already. Setups: This will be a progressive, annual log of my daily carry or common pieces of software I use to do my job and/or tinker with in my spare time. Github: Where I host my coding projects, and the code for this very site. Bluesky: It’s like Twitter used to be, but with some cool social-web features. TTFN ‘Nuff said for now, I think. So despite a delayed launch, here we are. I look forward to poking my head back in when there’s more to report.\nFor my sins, as we say back home. ↩︎\nNot an affiliate link, by the way. ↩︎\nIt saves time on long discussions about topics people may or may not be mildly interest in if you can just hand them a blog post they can read or not read later. ↩︎\n",

<p>Well, in answer to your first question, my name is Jacob. I&rsquo;m a 20something web-developer and tech enthusiast. I hail from Northern Ireland, but live in England<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked technology, too, but have had a reticence to write about it. The world feels inundated with tech-sites and reviewers these days. So who in the world thinks they can take on collectives like <em><a href="theverge.com">The Verge</a></em> or the vast army of YouTube channels focused on observing the ever-shifting sands of the tech industry?</p>
<p>But, as ever with people and their hobbies, I&rsquo;ve always found myself <em>thinking</em> about topics in this world, or around and about it.</p>
<p>I have <em>some</em> friends I can talk about those thoughts to, sure. What I&rsquo;ve never granted myself, however, was a space to really flesh them out or put them down in a way that feels more concrete and shareable.</p>

<p>Austin Kleon has a chapter in his book <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/show-your-work-10-ways-to-share-your-creativity-and-get-discovered-austin-kleon/2862487">Show Your Work</a></em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> titled &ldquo;<em>Become a Documentarian of What You Do.</em>&rdquo; In a slightly orthogonal vein, this little pocket of the web is my documentation on what I <em>think</em> of ideas about, matters in, or products made within the modern tech scene.</p>
<p>Mostly, and genuinely, it&rsquo;s somewhere for me to collect all of those things to show people later. I don&rsquo;t have analytics, or sponsored reviews, or even interest in either of those things. I don&rsquo;t really care about that type of success.</p>
<p>In a sense, as welcome as you are to stick around, this site isn&rsquo;t made for a mass audience of random people.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s not you. It&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m just not ready for that level of commitment.</p>
<p>All joking aside, as I said before, I want to put things here to show people I know or happen to meet.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Living up to it&rsquo;s name, <a href="/">Jacob&rsquo;s Tech Corner</a> is just that, for me to store in and lift out of as needed.</p>

<p>That said, there are few cool bits and bobs here already that might catch your eye:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/posts">Posts</a></strong>: If you&rsquo;re reading this, I assume you&rsquo;ve found that page already.</li>
<li><strong><a href="/setups">Setups</a></strong>: This will be a progressive, annual log of my daily carry or common pieces of software I use to do my job and/or tinker with in my spare time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jacobtmurph">Github</a></strong>: Where I host my coding projects, and the code for this very site.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jacob.andrewsmurphy.online">Bluesky</a></strong>: It&rsquo;s like Twitter used to be, but with some cool social-web features.</li>

<p>&lsquo;Nuff said for now, I think. So despite a delayed launch, here we are. I look forward to poking my head back in when there&rsquo;s more to report.</p>
