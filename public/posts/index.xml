<p>Hello there, and sorry I&rsquo;m late!</p>
<p>And boy, <em>am I late.</em> This whole project is far overdue my original estimate. Even more so because I tend to drag my feet about things I actually really want to do. Building this site shouldn&rsquo;t have taken as long as it did. Then again, maybe it also took as long as I needed to actually commit to doing it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m jumping ahead of myself. Who the heck am I, and what is this quaint little site all about?</p>

<p>Well, in answer to your first question, my name is Jacob. I&rsquo;m a 20something web-developer and tech enthusiast. I hail from Northern Ireland, but live in England<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked technology, too, but have had a reticence to write about it. The world feels inundated with tech-sites and reviewers these days. So who in the world thinks they can take on collectives like <em><a href="theverge.com">The Verge</a></em> or the vast army of YouTube channels focused on observing the ever-shifting sands of the tech industry?</p>
<p>But, as ever with people and their hobbies, I&rsquo;ve always found myself <em>thinking</em> about topics in this world, or around and about it.</p>
<p>I have <em>some</em> friends I can talk about those thoughts to, sure. What I&rsquo;ve never granted myself, however, was a space to really flesh them out or put them down in a way that feels more concrete and shareable.</p>

<p>Austin Kleon has a chapter in his book <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/show-your-work-10-ways-to-share-your-creativity-and-get-discovered-austin-kleon/2862487">Show Your Work</a></em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> titled &ldquo;<em>Become a Documentarian of What You Do.</em>&rdquo; In a slightly orthogonal vein, this little pocket of the web is my documentation on what I <em>think</em> of ideas about, matters in, or products made within the modern tech scene.</p>
<p>Mostly, and genuinely, it&rsquo;s somewhere for me to collect all of those things to show people later. I don&rsquo;t have analytics, or sponsored reviews, or even interest in either of those things. I don&rsquo;t really care about that type of success.</p>
<p>In a sense, as welcome as you are to stick around, this site isn&rsquo;t made for a mass audience of random people.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s not you. It&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m just not ready for that level of commitment.</p>
<p>All joking aside, as I said before, I want to put things here to show people I know or happen to meet.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Living up to it&rsquo;s name, <a href="/">Jacob&rsquo;s Tech Corner</a> is just that, for me to store in and lift out of as needed.</p>

<p>That said, there are few cool bits and bobs here already that might catch your eye:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/posts">Posts</a></strong>: If you&rsquo;re reading this, I assume you&rsquo;ve found that page already.</li>
<li><strong><a href="/setups">Setups</a></strong>: This will be a progressive, annual log of my daily carry or common pieces of software I use to do my job and/or tinker with in my spare time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jacobtmurph">Github</a></strong>: Where I host my coding projects, and the code for this very site.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jacob.andrewsmurphy.online">Bluesky</a></strong>: It&rsquo;s like Twitter used to be, but with some cool social-web features.</li>
</ul>

<p>&lsquo;Nuff said for now, I think. So despite a delayed launch, here we are. I look forward to poking my head back in when there&rsquo;s more to report.</p>
