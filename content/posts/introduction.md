## About Time 
Hello there, and sorry I'm late!

And boy, *am I late.* This whole project is far overdue my original estimate. Even more so because I tend to drag my feet about things I actually really want to do. Building this site shouldn't have taken as long as it did. Then again, maybe it also took as long as I needed to actually commit to doing it.

But I'm jumping ahead of myself. Who the heck am I, and what is this quaint little site all about?

## First Things First
Well, in answer to your first question, my name is Jacob. I'm a 20something web-developer and tech enthusiast. I hail from Northern Ireland, but live in England[^1], and I've always enjoyed writing. 

I've always liked technology, too, but have had a reticence to write about it. The world feels inundated with tech-sites and reviewers these days. So who in the world thinks they can take on collectives like *[The Verge](theverge.com)* or the vast army of YouTube channels focused on observing the ever-shifting sands of the tech industry? 

But, as ever with people and their hobbies, I've always found myself *thinking* about topics in this world, or around and about it. 

I have *some* friends I can talk about those thoughts to, sure. What I've never granted myself, however, was a space to really flesh them out or put them down in a way that feels more concrete and shareable. 

## To the Point
Austin Kleon has a chapter in his book *[Show Your Work](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/show-your-work-10-ways-to-share-your-creativity-and-get-discovered-austin-kleon/2862487)*[^2] titled "*Become a Documentarian of What You Do.*" In a slightly orthogonal vein, this little pocket of the web is my documentation on what I *think* of ideas about, matters in, or products made within the modern tech scene.

Mostly, and genuinely, it's somewhere for me to collect all of those things to show people later. I don't have analytics, or sponsored reviews, or even interest in either of those things. I don't really care about that type of success.

In a sense, as welcome as you are to stick around, this site isn't made for a mass audience of random people.

Don't worry, it's not you. It's me. I'm just not ready for that level of commitment.

All joking aside, as I said before, I want to put things here to show people I know or happen to meet.[^3] Living up to it's name, [Jacob's Tech Corner](/) is just that, for me to store in and lift out of as needed.
## Poke Around
That said, there are few cool bits and bobs here already that might catch your eye:
- **[Posts](/posts)**: If you're reading this, I assume you've found that page already.
- **[Setups](/setups)**: This will be a progressive, annual log of my daily carry or common pieces of software I use to do my job and/or tinker with in my spare time.
- **[Github](https://github.com/jacobtmurph)**: Where I host my coding projects, and the code for this very site.
- **[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jacob.andrewsmurphy.online)**: It's like Twitter used to be, but with some cool social-web features.
## TTFN
'Nuff said for now, I think. So despite a delayed launch, here we are. I look forward to poking my head back in when there's more to report.
[^1]: For my sins, as we say back home.
[^2]: Not an affiliate link, by the way.
[^3]: It saves time on long discussions about topics people may or may not be mildly interest in if you can just hand them a blog post they can read or not read later.
